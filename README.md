# sslide

this is a script to batch create slides with latex that share the same visual formatting.
i wrote this to help my partner help cut out some redundancies from their workload, so it's quite specific to their job.

**dependencies:** texlive-core, texlive-latexextra, poppler.

**to-do:**

	* integrate .pdf to .pptx/.odp conversion for (editable) use in google slides
	* option to redo an individual slide in case of incorrect info
	* visual previews in zenity file selection?
